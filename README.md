##Objective
Given the data on School performance and funding, use Python's pandas library to prepare an analysis that highlights the performance of the district and its respective schools based on the following Criteria: 

### A.) District Summary

* Calculate the total number of schools

* Calculate the total number of students

* Calculate the total budget

* Calculate the average math score 

* Calculate the average reading score

* Calculate the overall passing rate (overall average score), i.e. (avg. math score + avg. reading score)/2

* Calculate the percentage of students with a passing math score (70 or greater)

* Calculate the percentage of students with a passing reading score (70 or greater)

* Create a dataframe to hold the above results

* Optional: give the displayed data cleaner formatting 

### B.) School Summary
* Create an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)
  
* Create a dataframe to hold the above results
